    <h3>The difference between HTML and CSS</h3>

    <em><p>
        HTML and CSS - a modern love story..... HTML and CSS have been in a happy and functional relationship for many years. As a pair they couldn't be more different, but it is precisely these differences that make them such a compatible pair. HTML is a few years
    older than CSS. The two met back in the early 90's and have been inseperable ever since. Earlier this year HTML and CSS defied the odds of the housing market and bought some land. HTML drafted up the initial plans. HTML doesn't care much for frills
    and is really only interested in a solid structure and functionality. CSS showcased their talents when it came to the interior design and overall look of the property. The results were stunning. Both HTML and CSS are keen on self improvement, and
    keep their relationship fresh by constantly reinventing themselves.

    <p>In other words, HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language is the basic buidling block of any webpage.
