            <h3><strong>Long term career goals</strong></h3>

            <p>My long term goal is to have sufficient software development skills to work remotely. I want to be competitive enough to choose to work on my own terms.</p>
            <p>At this point I don’t know if this will be in the new field of web development or in a field adjacent to my previous experience such as data science or medical technology. </p>

            <h3><strong>Strenghts and limitations in learning</strong></h3>

            <p>
                My perfectionism is a double edged sword that serves as both a strength and a weakness.</p>

            <p>I have a sharp attention to detail and am sometimes too focused on what I can’t do or haven’t done rather than what I can do or have achieved.</p>

            <p>I’m good at structuring my time and work. Sometimes I set unrealistic goals or fail to set healthy boundaries for myself when it comes to learning.



                <h3><strong>Human skills I would like to develop and improve</strong></h3>

                <p>
                    I would like to develop my conflict resolution and my need to try and control things, especially in a high pressure environment.</p>

                <p>I work well with others and enjoy being part of a team but I look forward to challenging this in the pressure cooker that is the Bootcamp environment.</p>

                <h3><strong>A commitment to how I will manage my workload during this programme</strong></h3>

                <p>
                    I commit first and foremost to self-care, prioritising my mental, spiritual and physical wellbeing and knowing that this will enable me to do my best work, both during this course, and as I enter a new professional field at a junior level.

                </p>

                <p>
                    I commit to working in a steady and sustainable fashion. I know that bringing my best self to work every day will ensure that I can work productively and engage effectively and compassionately with both my peers and facilitators.

                </p>

                <p> I commit to sharing any learnings I found helpful, in terms of both tech and core modules, with my peers.</p>

                <p>
                    I will set clear boundaries. I will make sure to take time each day for myself. I will ensure I get enough sleep, eat well and move my body every day.

                </p>

                <p>
                    I have let my partner, family and friends know that this course will be a huge priority for me over the coming months, and have communicated that my social engagements will be of quality rather than quantity over this time.

                </p>

                <p>
                    If things are building up and starting to affect me negatively, I will communicate this to my support network - I consider my support during this time to my partner, my close friends, my peers and my facilitators.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the situation it will sometimes be appropriate to speak to my personal connections, and at other times to my peers or facilitator.

                </p>

                <p>
                    I will take a step back, breathe and be patient with myself. If the overwhelm stems from expectations I have placed on myself, I will remember to review these. I will call on my partner to help me review these expectations.

                </p>

                <p>
                    If the overwhelm stems from an external source such as course content or group projects, I commit to communicating this to my teammates and/ or facilitator in a timely manner - timely meaning that I don’t impact my team mates work or timelines.
                </p>


                <h3><strong>What I expect of the facilitation team</strong></h3>

                <p>
                    I expect the facilitation team to support me to learn, as opposed to ‘teaching’ me anything. I expect a weekly check-in for the purpose of progress reporting and answering any non-urgent questions I may have gathered from that week.
                </p>

                <P>
                    In the event that my course mates or partner can’t help me, I expect the support of my facilitators in the event that I am unable to work through a technical road - block, despite trying to the best of my ability.

                </P>

                <p>
                    I commit to communicating such issues clearly - demonstrating my comprehension of the problem, and the troubleshooting attempts I have made.

                </p>

                <h3><strong>Block out times and other commitments</strong></h3>

                <p>
                    I acknowledge the priviledged position I am in to be able to prioritise this course over other commitments for the next few months.

                </p>
