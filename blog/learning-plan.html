            <h3><strong>Long term career goals</strong></h3>

            <p>My long term goal is to have sufficient software development skills to work remotely. I want to be competitive enough to choose to work on my own terms, choosing good and meaningful work that aligns with my values.</p>
            <p>At this point I don’t know if this will be in the new field of web development or in a field adjacent to my previous experience such as data science or medical technology. </p>

            <h3><strong>Strengths and limitations in learning</strong></h3>

            <p>
                My perfectionism is a double edged sword that serves as both a strength and a weakness.</p>

            <p>I have a sharp attention to detail and am sometimes too focused on what I can’t do or haven’t done rather than what I can do or have achieved.</p>

            <p>I’m good at structuring my time and work. Sometimes I set unrealistic goals or fail to set healthy boundaries for myself when it comes to learning.



                <h3><strong>Human skills I would like to develop and improve</strong></h3>

                <p>
                    I would like to develop my conflict resolution and my need to try and control things, especially in a high pressure environment.</p>

                <p>I work well with others and enjoy being part of a team but I look forward to challenging this in the pressure cooker that is the Bootcamp environment.</p>

                <h3><strong>A commitment to how I will manage my workload during this programme</strong></h3>

                <p>
                    I commit first and foremost to self-care, prioritising my mental, spiritual and physical wellbeing and knowing that this will enable me to do my best work, both during this course, and as I enter a new professional field at a junior level.

                </p>

                <p>
                    I commit to working in a steady and sustainable fashion. I know that bringing my best self to work every day will ensure that I can work productively and engage effectively and compassionately with both my peers and facilitators.

                </p>

                <p> I commit to sharing any learnings I found helpful, in terms of both tech and core modules, with my peers.</p>

                <p>
                    I will set clear boundaries. I will make sure to take time each day for myself. I will ensure I get enough sleep, eat well and move my body every day.

                </p>

                <p>
                    I have let my partner, family and friends know that this course will be a huge priority for me over the coming months, and have communicated that my social engagements will be of quality rather than quantity over this time.

                </p>

                <p>
                    If things are building up and starting to affect me negatively, I will communicate this to my support network - I consider my support during this time to my partner, my close friends, my peers and my facilitators.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the situation it will sometimes be appropriate to speak to my personal connections, and at other times to my peers or facilitator.

                </p>

                <p>
                    I will take a step back, breathe and be patient with myself. If the overwhelm stems from expectations I have placed on myself, I will remember to review these. I will call on my partner to help me review these expectations.

                </p>

                <p>
                    If the overwhelm stems from an external source such as course content or group projects, I commit to communicating this to my teammates and/ or facilitator in a timely manner - timely meaning that I don’t impact my team mates work or timelines.
                </p>


                <h3><strong>What I expect of the facilitation team</strong></h3>

                <p>
                    I expect the facilitation team to support me to learn, as opposed to ‘teaching’ me anything. I expect a weekly check-in for the purpose of progress reporting and answering any non-urgent questions I may have gathered from that week.
                </p>

                <P>
                    In the event that my course mates or partner can’t help me, I expect the support of my facilitators in the event that I am unable to work through a technical road - block, despite trying to the best of my ability.

                </P>

                <p>
                    I commit to communicating such issues clearly - demonstrating my comprehension of the problem, and the troubleshooting attempts I have made.

                </p>

                <h3><strong>Block out times and other commitments</strong></h3>

                <p>
                    I acknowledge the priviledged position I am in to be able to prioritise this course over other commitments for the next few months.

        <h2 id=reflections>Pre Bootcamp Reflection questions</h2>


        <h4>3rd October 2021</h4>


        <h3><strong>What are your long term goals or career pathway</strong></h3>

        <p>
            My goal at the moment is non specific, as I don't yet know what aspect of web development will appeal to me most. I may also feel pulled to link in my previous career as a medical scientist and study a statistical language when I finish the course. Regardless,
            my reason for learning web developemnt is so I can possess a skill that enables me to choose work on my own terms. I want to be skilled enough so I can choose to work with ethical companies that align with my values and who's aim is to make
            a positive impact in the world. I want to have enough skill to choose work that I am passionate about. I want to be skilled enough so I can choose work that is flexible and affords me a work life balance and the space to pursue my side passions.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong></h3>
        <p>
            I think my strengths will be my people skills and the fact that I enjoy being part of a team working towards something together. I acknowledge that this understanding of myself will be challenged within the high pressure environment of bootcamp. My main
            weakness will be my technical ability and self doubt. I have a tendancy to give myself a mental block when learning something I find very challenging, although I have been working on this during foundations and realise that taking more frequent
            breaks helps a lot.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Some non techincal challenges I forsee include:
            <ul>
                <li>Speaking in front of a group - while I have done this heaps in my previous career, I still find it nerve wracking. As a tech novice with a minimal grasp of the lingo, there will be plenty opportunities for cringe :P </li>
                <li>Asking for help ( and asking well framed questions) - I have noticed during foundations how much energy it takes to put yourself out there and ask for help. I sometimes find it difficult to frame my questions in a direct and clear way,
                    depending on the subject matter. I find this is sometimes because I have allowed myself to get wound up before reaching out for help. I plan to mitigate this by practicing self awareness and taking more breaks or coming back to the
                    problem again later.</li>
                <li>Getting good sleep - when I am under stress or pressure, sleep is the first thing to suffer. I plan to help mitigate this by allowing for at least an hour before bed each night to switch off.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>


        <h3><strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong></h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Giving useful help - being confident enough in my own understanding that I can convey it to someone else in a useful manner.</li>
            <li>Giving honest, measured and helpful feedback.</li>
            <li>Managing my own overwhelm - catching myself before I've already wound myself up and taking timely breaks.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3><strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team? What does support look like to you?</strong></h3>


        <p>
            My expectations of the Bootcamp team are similiar to that of the foundations team - I expect the Bootcamp team to support me to learn. I expect a check-in at the end of each phase for the purpose of progress reporting and answering any non-urgent questions
            I may have, as well as delivering feedback. In the event of a more time dependant question or issue that I have been unable to solve by other means, I would expect some support upon asking a well framed question and showing my attempts up
            to that point.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely
    way?</strong></h3>

        <p>My expectations are that I will give each challenge my best effort, and that if I am struggling, to reach out to my team/ wider cohort in a timely manner - that is in a manner that doesn't disrupt the workflow or deadlines of any of my team mates.
            My expectations of myself are that if I need to reach out to a teacher, that I do it in enough time that they can help me without having to scramble before a deadline.</p>

        <p>
            I commit to putting in 60 hours of my best effort each week of Bootcamp. I commit to showing up well rested and on time each day of Bootcamp. I commit to bringing the best possible version of myself each day. I wish to show empathy and compassion when
            dealing with myself and others during this time. I commit to a routine of 10 hour days midweek with 5 - 6 hours of work on both Saturday and Sunday. I commit to eating well and getting 8 hours of sleep a night. I commit to exercising every
            day by walking to and from the EDA site( or if we are working remotely, by getting an hour in nature each day). I commit to the two yoga classes offered per week and one class a week at my regular studio. I commit to one night off per week
            to spend intentional time with my partner.
        </p>

        <p>
            I commit to engaging with the human skills coordinator and reaching out if I need support. I commit to self awareness and awareness of how my energy and actions affects other students, teachers, and community representatives.
        </p>
